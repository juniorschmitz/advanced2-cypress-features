# [Cypress advanced - TAU]

This is a repo that used as base the TAU course [Test automation University course on advanced Cypress](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/advanced-cypress-tutorial/) by [Applitools](http://applitools.com/).

The repo has all implementations plus my insights and new implementations based on advanced Cypress features.

## Instalation/Executiong the SUT
`clone this repo`

`npm install`

`npm start`

After that, the System Under Test should be up and running, ready for running our Cypress scenarios.

Special thanks to Filip (https://filiphric.com), who taught the course on the TAU.
